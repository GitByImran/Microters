                  Photography for beginners is about capturing moments, telling
                  stories, and expressing creativity. Start with simple
                  equipment, learn the basics of composition and lighting.
                  Experiment with different subjects and perspectives. Embrace
                  mistakes as part of the learning process. With practice,
                  patience, and a keen eye, you'll grow as a photographer.
